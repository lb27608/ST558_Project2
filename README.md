# Purpose

This project creates an app to explore a set of sales data from US superstores (<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/juhi1994/superstore/data>). Specifically, the app allows a user to subset the data by region (West, Central, South, or East), market segment (corporate, home office, or consumer), and/or product category (furniture, office supplies, or technology). For any subset of data, the user can then summarize data about sales and profit.
